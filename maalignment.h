		How?
			(do not need but to be clear: observed frequencies d1, d2, ..., dk)
			logLL --> likelihood: p1, p2 ... pk
			Because we have in total 4^n patterns but may observe k < 4^n patterns ==> p1 + p2 + ... + pk <= 1.
			This also means (p1 + p2 + ... + pk)*ell <= ell
			Now we want to derive expected frequencies ^d1, ^d2, ..., ^dk such that ^d1 + ^d2 + ... + ^dk = ell based on p1, p2, ..., pk.
			We do the followings:
			+ Compute li = ell*pi / sum_i(pi)  ==> sum_i (li) = ell
			+ Because li is usually not an integer, we now have to round li as below:
				* r1 = l1
				* r_{i+1} = l_{i+1} + r_{i} - [r_i]
				* Finally set: ^d_i = [r_i]
				* where [.] denotes ordinary rounding
